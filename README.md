Project Syntropy

Description

Project Syntropy is an applied research initiative that explores a systematic, first-principles approach to socio-technical systems development. The project emphasizes data-driven decision-making, adaptive scaling, and continuous improvement to facilitate the evolution of self-enhancing human–AI collaborative systems, platforms, and organizations.

Our core framework, Target-Driven Iterative Refinement (TDIR), models and optimizes goal-oriented workflows through iterative, measurable simulations, leveraging insights to refine organizational strategies and technical solutions effectively.

Core Objectives
	•	Scientific Optimization: Transform intuitive processes in engineering, research, and strategic management into quantifiable, optimized methodologies.
	•	Adaptive Scaling: Build scalable and modular platforms that dynamically adapt and scale with changing organizational needs and technological advances.
	•	Continuous Improvement: Systematically measure, simulate, and enhance workflows, enabling organizations to iteratively refine their operational models.
	•	Human–AI Collaboration: Foster harmonious and productive interactions between humans and AI, enabling socio-technical systems that evolve and improve autonomously.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.13+
	•	Docker & Docker Compose
	•	Node.js 24 (for local Web UI development)

Installation

Install via pipx:

pipx install syntropy-cli

Project Initialization

Navigate to your project directory and initialize:

syntropy project init

Starting the Platform

Start the local environment:

syntropy system start

Accessing the Web UI

Open the platform observability dashboard:

syntropy system ui

Running Simulations

Execute a new simulation workflow:

syntropy run simulation
